# Hackbridge Art Centre

A website for a local community centre art club.

## Description

This website was created having with artsy context in mind with bold use of colours referring to the main banner image which set the colour scheme for the whole website. Large art-related images are meant to catch attention and give instant view of the club's offer. CSS animations were also used to add interactivity to the website. Use of fexbox ensured responsiveness.
